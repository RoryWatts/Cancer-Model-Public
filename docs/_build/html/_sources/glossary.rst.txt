   coverage
      The percentage of the population who are able to access cancer treatment
      When a person has access to cancer services, they are said to be covered
      When a person does not have access to cancer services, they are said to be uncovered

   distribution
   	  The proportion of cancer cases which are diagnosed in each cancer stage (Stage I, II, III & IV)

   package
      A selection of interventions which are included in the cancer programme 
      These packages are hierarchical in terms of effectiveness i.e. package 3 > 2 > 1 

   programme
      The programme refers to the set of packages which are being implemented in the country, for the set of cancers.
      For example, if a country is implementing package 3 for breast cancer, and package 2 for colorectal cancer, these two
      packages are referred to as the programme

   macro
   	  A macro is Excel's method of automating a series of actions. This is very similar to referring to something as a 'script' or a 'program'.

   	  In this model, we have two macros

   	  The first macro runs the model for one country

   	  The second macro runs the model for every country

   	  You can find out more information on the macro page.

   model
      The series of calculations which take inputs and assumptions and produce outputs

   output
      The model takes inputs, and performs calculations. The data that is calculated is then called the output.
      In this model, we are interested in four types of output

      Lives saved: How many more people survived in the intervention scenario, compared with the reference scenario?
      Healthy life years gained: How many healthy life years were added as a result of the intervention scenario, compared with the reference scenario?
      Costs: What was the difference in cost between the intervention scenario and the reference scenario?
      Volumes: How many units of drugs, equipment, health professionals were needed in the intervention scenario, compared with the reference scenario?

   scenario
   	  A situation where one set of programmes is implemented
   	  In this model, scenarios are compared to understand the effects of scaling up cancer services, and the impact of COVID-19

   	  There is a reference scenario - which produces outputs on the assumption that coverage and treatments do not change in the given time period.

   	  There is an interventions scenario - where cancer services are scaled up, so that they reach more of the population, and so they offer more services to people, reducing their likelihood of dying from cancer.

   transition rate
      The probability that a person will die in a year

   workbook
      The excel file which holds the model, and the data for the model

   worksheets
      The individual tabs within the workbook which hold data, perform calculations, or show the output of calculations
