The Macros
==========

The output from this model is generated by two macros.

The first macro is called the "individual country macro" and produces output for the selected country.

The second macro is called the "all country macro" and produces output for all countries.

We will talk in depth about the "individual country macro" below, and then briefly talk about the "all country macro". There is less need to talk about the "all country macro" because it is just an extension of the "individual country macro".
