Overview
==========

The model is built to compare two *scenarios*.

A reference scenario, where the current cancer programmes operate at the same coverage level until 2030. 

An intervention scenario, where the current cancer programmes increase in some coverage level until achieving a target coverage level in 2030. Furthermore, in the intervention scenario, cancer programmes may also expand what is provided to patients, increasing their likelihood of survival.
