Overview

Rationale
^^^^^^^^^

The model is built to compare two *scenarios*.

A reference scenario, where the current cancer programmes operate at the same coverage level until 2030. 

An intervention scenario, where the current cancer programmes increase in some coverage level until achieving a target coverage level in 2030. Furthermore, in the intervention scenario, cancer programmes may also expand what is provided to patients, increasing their likelihood of survival. 

Basic Structure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Our model is built into an excel workbook. 
Within the workbook, there are several worksheets which store data, do calculations, and present results.
There are six types of worksheets in the workbook, which are as follows: profile, impact, results, costs, config, and lookup. These will be discussed below.
